                    <h3>Chaser, Scholar of the Burning Blood</h3>
                    <p>Was once an aspiring Diver, graduating as one of the greatest of his generation, only surpassed
                        by Klaris Llfiend, Mother of Lights and Akira. Eventually, he betrayed the Divers, joining the Ministry instead.
                        He served as an apprentice for and was gifted the ability of hemokinesis by the Ministry's Second Prophet.</p>
                        
                    <h3>Klaris Llfiend</h3>
                    <p>Of the Divers, she is considered one of the strongest, surpassing Chaser and being on par with Akira to the point
                        that he cannot instantly kill her with his Resonance, as well as being able to become intangible.
                        She is rather rude at times, frequently insulting those she views as weak, and is generally disliked by her fellow Divers.
                        She also appears rather arrogant, as she banished Cap'n Orlandeau to New Kyrsa</p>

                    <h3>Zi'eer "The Lord Regent"</h3>
                    <p> Zi'eer, more commonly known as The Lord Regent or by his title, the fourth Prophet of The Ministry, is a mysterious and powerful NPC that resides exclusively inside his palace within Etris.
                        He is the interim ruler of Etrea, holding absolute power over the entire nation until the "King" returns to his people.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Evengarde Rest</h3>
                    <p>Evengarde Rest is the current Maestro of the Vigil Guard and is highly respected by all of them.
                        He resides within the Isle of Vigils and is found in their dojo, watching people train.
                        A kind of intimidating air lingers around him,</p>
