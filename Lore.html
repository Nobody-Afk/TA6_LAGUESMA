                <h3>The tide</h3>
                <p>the Tide seems to be connected to the Canticlysm, a catastrophic event that reshaped the world of Lumen.
                    The Canticlysm is mentioned in the soundtrack description for "A Memory of Tides," which suggests that it was
                    a time when the "depths of sea come alive in a motion, strongly shakes the land and the sky from the ocean."</p>
                    <h3>The Song</h3>
                    <p>The Song appears to be a powerful force that resonates throughout the world.
                        In the soundtrack description for "The Gideshu March," it's mentioned that the march became popular among the Central Authority's soldiers, with some considering
                        it to be their unofficial anthem. This suggests that the Song has a significant impact on the world's inhabitants.</p>
                    <h3>Resonance</h3>
                    <p>Resonance seems to be connected to the Song, as it's mentioned in the context of the Depths, a realm that consists of multiple layers.
                        The flavor text for the Depths mentions that "you can feel your soul dragging down like a weight, deeper, further into the depths,"
                        implying that Resonance is a force that draws beings into the Depths.</p>
                    <h3>Attunements</h3>
                    <p>Attunements are forms of magic that players can choose during Character Creation or obtain through Trainers in the game.
                        There are various types of Attunements, such as Flamecharm, Frostdraw, and Ether, each with its unique abilities and effects.</p>
                    <h3>The Depths</h3>
                    <p>The Depths in Deepwoken are a mysterious and foreboding realm that players can access after dying twice.
                        It's a realm of darkness and corruption, where the laws of the Overworld do not apply.
                        The Depths are said to be infinite, with new layers being discovered as one delves deeper.
                        They are connected to the concept of Resonance, a force that draws beings into the Depths.
                        The Depths are home to ancient, eldritch beings and are said to be corrupting, with those who venture too deep risking mental and physical degradation.
                        Despite the dangers, many are drawn to the Depths, seeking answers to the mysteries of the world and the secrets of the Song.</p>
